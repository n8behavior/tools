Runbooks
========

Overview
--------
Each project has a information repository called a runbook.  The runbook is created at project setup and is updated throughout the life of the project.  All changes are tracked and trigger a contunous deployment process that ensures the latest version is published to our cloud platform.  Access to the runbook is handled via OAUTH based on an extendable list of providers.
